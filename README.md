# Setu HTTP Client 🛠️

> A modern, tiny, isomorphic HTTP client for Node.js and browsers with built-in timeout, retries, and progress support.

---

## 🚀 Why Setu?

**Setu** (meaning "bridge" in Sanskrit) bridges the gap between **Node.js** and **browser environments** for making HTTP requests.

It gives you:

- The **control** of low-level clients like `fetch` or `http.request`
- The **simplicity** of high-level clients like `axios`

All in **one lightweight, modern, tree-shakable package**.

✅ Automatic retry mechanism

✅ Upload/Download progress tracking
